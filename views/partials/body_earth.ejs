<p>Earth is the planet we call home, and the third planet in sequence. It is different from many other planets because it is covered 70% by water, making it the only known planet to support life. Our atmoosphere also allows us to live with the oxygen and nitrogen makeup. Another interesting thing about earth is that it is the only planet that has just one moon. As many of us already know, a day on Earth last 25 hours and a year last 365.25 days. That .25 day is the reason why we have aleap year every 4 years!</p>
